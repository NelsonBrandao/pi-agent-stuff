# PR Review Skill

Address PR review feedback for the current branch.

## Workflow: Address Reviews

When asked to address PR reviews, follow this sequence:

### 1. Get PR context

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,state,body,reviewDecision,headRefName,baseRefName,statusCheckRollup
```

### 2. Read unresolved review comments

Only fetch unresolved threads — ignore anything already resolved:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            isResolved
            comments(first: 10) {
              nodes {
                databaseId
                author { login }
                body
                path
                line
                createdAt
                diffHunk
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner="{owner}" -f repo="{repo}" -F pr=<number> --jq '
  .data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | select(.isResolved == false)
  | .comments.nodes[]
  | "ID: \(.databaseId)\nFile: \(.path):\(.line // "?")\nAuthor: \(.author.login) (\(.createdAt | split("T")[0]))\n\(.diffHunk | split("\n") | .[-3:] | map("  │ \(.)") | join("\n"))\n💬 \(.body)\n"
'
```

### 3. Check changed files

```bash
gh pr view --json files --jq '.files[] | "\(.status)  +\(.additions) -\(.deletions)  \(.path)"'
```

### 4. Read diff for context

```bash
gh pr diff                        # full diff
gh pr diff | awk '/^diff --git.*<file>/{show=1} /^diff --git/ && !/'"<file>"'/{show=0} show'  # single file
```

### 5. Make the code changes

Read the files mentioned in review comments and address the feedback.

### 6. Commit and push

Write a commit message that describes what actually changed, not just "address review feedback".

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Refactor auth middleware to validate tokens before routing" && git push
```

### 7. Resolve or reply to comments

For each review comment, decide based on whether action was taken:

**If code changes were made to address the comment** — resolve the thread silently (no reply needed). Find the thread ID and resolve it:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes {
                databaseId
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner="{owner}" -f repo="{repo}" -F pr=<number>
```

Then resolve the thread using its GraphQL node ID:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }
' -f threadId="<thread-node-id>"
```

**If no action was taken** (e.g., disagree, out of scope, already handled, intentional) — reply explaining why:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies" -f body="<explanation of why no action was taken>"
```

### 8. Verify CI

```bash
gh pr checks
```

## Top-level review summaries

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/reviews" --jq '.[] | select(.state != "COMMENTED") | "[\(.state)] \(.user.login): \(.body)"'
```
